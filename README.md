# rlog shiny demo

A little [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) app to demonstrate logging with [rlog](https://github.com/sellorm/rlog).

It's also helpful too to explore how log levels work.

This app was written to accompany [this blog post](https://blog.sellorm.com/2021/06/16/getting-started-with-logging-in-r/).
